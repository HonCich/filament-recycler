## About project
 The goal of the work is design and implementation of a machine for production and recyclation of 3D printing material for FDM 3D printers (filament). The emphasis is put on the simplicity of the resulting device and the ease of its production process.

 I started working on this project at the end of summer 2021 with great help from Ing. Martin Ptáček. It started as my project for Středoškolská odborná činnost, which is science competetion held in the Czech Republic. After this competetion I decided to continue and further upgrade this machine.

 At this moment project contains working designs of filament extruder, filament puller, electronics board and software.
